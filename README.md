# MedsPatPool_Appendix
Online Appendix for my paper "Global Drug Diffusion and Innovation with the Medicines Patent Pool"

The online appendix included additional information on data construction, extra figures and tables, mathematical derivation, extra medical and drug dosage conversion/comparison information, legal summary on licensing details regarding drugs in the Medicines Patent Pool (MPP), case studies, and a summmary of a set of historical patent pools. 

For readers most interested in extra analytical results, Appendix B (Figures and Tables) is the most relevant section. This repository intends to provide additional data and information that can be used for future research relevant to the MPP and more broadly global drug diffusion and innovation. 

If you are interested in other formats of data sets in the Online Appendix or generated out of this research, you can reach me at xw377@cornell.edu.
